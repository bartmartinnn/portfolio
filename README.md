# Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

Disclaimer: I use this repo as a way to display my skills. Sometimes some parts might be broken as I continue to experiment with new methods and tools :)

# USDA
Contains my exploration into USDA FoodCentral Database done for the purpose of MealTime, a startup that I'm building with my friends in free time

# Titanic
Contains my experimentation with Titanic dataset, mostly for learning, but I upload results to a Kaggle Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) - nickname Bart Martin (leaderboard gets wiped once in a while, so they might be gone)

# MNIST
Contains my experimentation with MNIST dataset, mostly for learning, but I upload results to a Kaggle Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/) - nickname Bart Martin (leaderboard gets wiped once in a while, so they might be gone)

# Setup
If you want to run the code on Apple M1 processors (aka Apple Silicon), as I did, then follow this setup https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/install/tensorflow-install-mac-metal-jul-2021.ipynb  

I didn't add data to the repo, but I have following folder setup, that you can add into project directory:
* data
    * titanic
    * mnist

To those folders simply put the "train.csv" and "test.csv" files from the kaggle competitions
