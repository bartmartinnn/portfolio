# Setup

If you want to run the code on Apple M1 processors (aka Apple Silicon), as I did, then follow this setup https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/install/tensorflow-install-mac-metal-jul-2021.ipynb  

I didn't add data to the repo, but I have following folder setup, that you can add into project directory:
* data
    * titanic
    * mnist

To those folders simply put the files from the kaggle competitions
